                 animated feature. Jealous of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent 
                 stepdaughter, but later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven
                  friendly little miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White,
                   who falls into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince.</p>

                  adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply held
                   secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below the water's surface.</p>
